### 1. Foundations

#### 1. The Role of Algorithms in Computing

###### 1.1 Algorithms
- > An algorithm is thus a sequence of `computational steps` that transform the
`input` into the `output`.

###### 1.2 Algorithms as a technology
- >we should consider algorithms, like computer hardware,
as a technology. Total system performance depends on choosing efficient
algorithms as much as on choosing fast hardware.
